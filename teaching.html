<p> All my unimelb teaching sites are on canvas now. </p>

<p> This year I am:
 <ul>
  <li>content coordinator for Real Analysis, 
<a href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2025/subjects/mast20026">MAST20026</a>
</li>
  <li>lecturing Partial Differential Equations, <a href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2025/subjects/mast90133">MAST90133</a></li>
</ul> 


</p>

<p>
First and second year undergraduate mathematics majors should consider taking the "advanced" subjects, including Real Analysis: Advanced, <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1slOKKJgM0Me-aDJejIKOvuoo_e-CuOaN">MAST20033</a>, a subject I helped create.
</p>

<p style="margin-top:1cm;">
<b>Animations:</b>  I like making interactive tutorials and
mathematics visualizations.  <b>Check out my github with matplotlib
animations <a
href="https://github.com/jessegell/math_visualizations">here</a>.</b>.
I also made a related <b>interactive tutorial on sequence convergence
that you can find <a
href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1slOKKJgM0Me-aDJejIKOvuoo_e-CuOaN">here</a>.</b>  In Real Analysis, students learn
mathematically rigorous notions of convergence.  Here is a video
showing a sequence of points in the plane converging to the origin.
</p>

<div class="container">
  <div class="video">
    <video id="myVideo" width="640" height="480" controls  muted>
      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/convergence_animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag./>
    </video>

    <script>
    var x = document.getElementById("myVideo");


    x.defaultPlaybackRate = 2;
    x.load();
 
    </script> 
    
  </div>
  </div>

  <p style="margin-top:0.5cm;"> The video shows the points in the
  sequence \[x_n = \frac{4}{(n+1)^{3}} + \frac{2}{(n+1)^2}, \quad y_n
  = \frac{2}{(n+1)^2},\] plotted in order \(n = 1, 2, \dots \).  This
  sequence converges to the origin \((0,0),\) which means that, for
  each ball around the origin, all but finitely many of the sequence
  points lie within it.  That is to say, for any radius \(\epsilon > 0,\)
  there is a sequence index \(N\) (the one indicated in the video)
  such that the \(N^{th}\) point and all subsequent points lie within
  distance \(\epsilon\) of \((0,0)\).

  <p>
  When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
  \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]
